we have two type of scroll Animation
1- Scroll Triggered Animations
2- Scroll Driven Animations

# Scroll Triggered Animations  
These animations are triggered when the user scrolls to a  
specific point in the viewport.Once the scroll reaches that  
point, the animation plays.  

Use Cases:  
Great for revealing elements, changing styles, or starting  
animations at specific sections of a page


# Scroll Driven Animations  
These animations continuously change as the user scrolls,  
allowing for a smoother, more interactive experience.The  
animation properties can be mapped directly to the scroll  
position.  

Use Cases:  
Ideal for parallax effects, transforming elements, or adjusting  
opacity based on scroll depth.

## whileInView Prop  

The whileInView prop is used to trigger animations when an element comes into the viewport. It allows us to define how an element should animate while it is visible on the screen. It enables us to create engaging animations that activate when the user scrolls to a specific part of your webpage.

## Viewport Prop  

The viewport prop is used to customize how animations are triggered based on the visibility of an element in the viewport. It allows us to specify settings that affect when and how animations occur as elements scroll into or out of view.
