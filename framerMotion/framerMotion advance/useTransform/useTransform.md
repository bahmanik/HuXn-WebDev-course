useTransform  

The useTransform hook is used to map one range of values to  
another.It's great for creating smooth animations and effects  
based on input values,like scroll position or mouse  
movements.

useTransform(<useMotion>, <[initial input, secondary output]>, <[initial output, secondary output]>)
