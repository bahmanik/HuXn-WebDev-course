Framer Motion
Framer Motion is a popular open-source library for React.js that allows developers to create animations and transitions easily. It provides a set of tools and APIs to animate components, enabling smooth, high-performance animations with minimal effort.

CSS Animations Pros
- Great for simple hover effects, transitions between states, or animations that don't require complex logic.
- CSS animations are typically very performant and can leverage GPU acceleration.
No need for additional libraries, so your bundle size remains smaller.

CSS Animation Cons
- More challenging to manage complex animations, such as coordinating multiple elements or responding to user interactions beyond simple events.
- Animating properties based on component state can be cumbersome.

Framer Motion Pros  

- Offers advanced capabilities like drag, gestures, and layout animations, which can be hard to achieve with pure CSS.  
- Integrates seamlessly with React's component model, allowing for easy management of state-driven animations.  
- Makes it easy to define and switch between different animation states.

Framer Motion Cons  

- Might take some time to get familiar with its API if you're new to it.  
- Adds extra weight to your application compared to using just CSS.

<!-- import { motion } from "framer-motion" -->

motion is an object that provides a set of components and hooks for creating animations and transitions in React applications.
When we use <motion.element> we're indicating that we want to animate that specific <element>. Framer Motion then provides additional props and features to facilitate those animations, such as initial, animate, and exit, allowing for more powerful and customizable animations.
