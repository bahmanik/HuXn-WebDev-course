# Variants  

Variants are a way to define different states or styles for our animations in a more organized way. Think of them as predefined animation setups that we can switch between easily.

# Define Variants  

Create a set of named styles (like "hidden," "visible," etc.) that describe how the element should look or behave in each state.  

## Use Variants  

Apply these variants to our animated component, making it easy to switch between states without repeating code.
