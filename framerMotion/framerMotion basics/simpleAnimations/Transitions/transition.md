# Transitions

Transitions are the effects that control how animations happen. Think of them as the “rules” for how an element moves or changes.

Transitions Properties
- **Duration**  How long the animation takes.
- **Easing**  The speed curve of the animation.
- **Delay**  How long to wait before starting the animation.
- **repeat**  How many times animation get reoeated.

tip: you can also add physics animation like transition={{ type: "spring", stiffness: 300 }}
